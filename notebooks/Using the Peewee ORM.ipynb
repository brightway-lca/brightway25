    "# Using the Peewee ORM\n",
    "\n",
    "Brightway uses the [Peewee ORM](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/) to interface with the SQLite3 relational database. Peewee, as its name implies, is small and simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make Brightway more approachable for users of all experience levels, there are actually three \"layers\" of data when using SQLite. You can see a row in the database table in three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The raw data, as stored in the SQLite database. This data uses SQL data types, so is not directly usable by Python.\n",
    "2. Peewee objects. The Peewee database schema is [provided here](https://github.com/brightway-lca/brightway2-data/blob/8d2e519f840ded0a700bb0d17df32e9182bb5577/bw2data/backends/schema.py). When Peewee retrieves a database row, it converts data to Python datatypes, and constructs objects based on the table schema. Peewee objects are instances of `ActivityDataset` and `ExchangeDataset`.\n",
    "3. `bw2data` `Activity` and `Exchange` objects. These are separate objects which offer a lot of new functionality. Originally, these objects were separate from `ActivityDataset` and `ExchangeDataset` because they served as the \"base\" proxies for all different kinds of data storage backends, including saving data as JSON files. Each `Activity` is associated with one `ActivityDataset`, and the same with exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally Brightway2 users only see the third layer - this notebook is about how to use the second layer. However, I let the Peewee documentation explain the Peewee-specific stuff."

    "## Limitations of the current schema\n",
    "\n",
    "There are (at least :) two things which will make people who know about databases unhappy about the current schema. First, we don't have actual foreign keys between `ActivityDataset` and `ExchangeDataset`. Second, we have generic \"data\" columns that can store additional data of multiple types without a fixed schema.\n",

    "Both of these design decisions were made intentionally, for better or worse.\n",

    "The lack of foreign keys allows users to enter relationships in the exchange table which don't yet exist in the activity table. This is in line with the philosophy of Brightway2, which is flexibility for many different use cases. Probably the next generation of Brightway will enforce a foreign key between these tables, however.\n",
