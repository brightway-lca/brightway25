Brightway2.5
============

Brightway 2.5 is the next generation of the [Brightway2](https://brightway.dev/) framework for life cycle assessment. It provides new capabilities for cloud computing and model interaction, with the use of a new [processed data library](https://github.com/brightway-lca/bw_processing) and a separation between the calculation library and a library for [matrix construction and manipulation](https://github.com/brightway-lca/matrix_utils).
